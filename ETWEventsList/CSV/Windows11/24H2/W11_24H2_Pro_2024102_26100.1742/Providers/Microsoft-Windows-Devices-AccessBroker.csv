Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Information,100,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) successfully accessed {InterfacePath}.
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Information,101,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) successfully accessed {InterfacePath}; the device interface class is unrestricted and allows access for LPAC apps.
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Information,102,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) successfully accessed {InterfacePath}; the device interface class is unrestricted.
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Information,103,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) successfully accessed {InterfacePath}; the app is granted unrestricted access based on its capabilities.
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Information,104,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) successfully accessed {InterfacePath}; the device container grants this app unrestricted access (i.e. legacy privileged app).
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Information,105,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) successfully accessed {InterfacePath}; the system is in embedded mode and the app has the low level devices capability.
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Error,200,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) failed to access {InterfacePath} (error = {Error}).
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Error,201,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) failed to access {InterfacePath}; the user cannot access the device (error = {Error}).
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Error,202,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) failed to access {InterfacePath}; the interface class is unrestricted but does not allow LPAC apps access (error = {Error}).
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Error,203,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) failed to access {InterfacePath}; the interface class is restricted and the app is LPAC (error = {Error}).
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Error,204,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) failed to access {InterfacePath}; the interface class is custom and nothing gives the app access (error = {Error}).                 One of the following methods may be used to grant an app access to a custom device:                 - an interface class may define access policy for either allowing unrestricted access or access restricted to a specific capability                 - a device interface instance may grant access to apps based on well-known or custom capabilities                 - (Deprecated) Privileged App Support: device metadata may grant access to specific PFNs associated to device container's PnP state                 Note: custom capabilities are typically the correct way to enable an app to access a custom device.
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Error,205,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) failed to access {InterfacePath}; the interface class is restricted by policy (error = {Error}).
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Error,206,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) failed to access {InterfacePath}; the interface instance is restricted (error = {Error}).
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Error,207,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) failed to access {InterfacePath}; the interface class does not allow raw handles to the device (error = {Error}).
Microsoft-Windows-Devices-AccessBroker,Error,208,0,System,DeviceAccessCheck,,,{ClientFileName} (pid = {ClientPid}) failed to access {InterfacePath}; the capability access check was denied (error = {Error}).
